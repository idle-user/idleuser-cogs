Originally, **[FJBot-DiscordBot](https://github.com/FancyJesse/fjbot-discordbot)** was a Discordpy project I started for fun and education. I did a lot of maintenance on it through the years.
Unfortunately, I decided to drop the project. I believe Red-DiscordBot is the better Discord Bot alternative out there today. 
I will be migrating my current work as a cog to the bot.
