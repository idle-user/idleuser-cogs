Originally named **[FJBot-DiscordBot](https://github.com/idle-user/fjbot-discordbot)** was a discordpy project I started for fun and education. I did a lot of maintenance on it through the years. Unfortunately, I decided to drop the project. I believe Red-DiscordBot is the better Discord Bot alternative out there today.

IdleUser's Cogs [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop).
Add the cogs to your instance with: `[p]repo add idleuser-cogs https://github.com/idle-user/idleuser-cogs/`
